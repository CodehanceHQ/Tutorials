## Comprehensive Git Workflow

### Understanding Git Concepts
```
# Questions:
# 1. What is a commit in Git, and why is it important?
# 2. What is the purpose of branching in Git?
# 3. How do feature branches help in development?
# 4. What is the main branch, and why is it critical?
# 5. Explain the concept of merging in Git.
# 6. How can merge conflicts arise, and how are they resolved?
```

### Step 2: Checkout the Main Branch
```
# Switch to the main branch:
git checkout main

# Questions:
# 1. Why is it important to be on the main branch before merging?
# 2. What is the difference between `git checkout main` and `git checkout -b main`?
```

### Step 3: Creating a Feature Branch
```
# Create a new feature branch with 3 commits:
git checkout -b DEAL-123-description 
# Make changes and commit them to your feature branch, make changes to your file after each commit.

git add .
git commit -m "DEAL-123: First commit"
git add .
git commit -m "DEAL-123: Second commit"
git add .
git commit -m "DEAL-123: Third commit"

# Diagram:
# Before Creating Feature Branch:
# Main Branch:    A---B---C---D
# After Creating Feature Branch:
# Main Branch:    A---B---C---D
# Feature Branch:        \---E---F---G

# Comment:
# This step shows the creation of a feature branch from the main branch and making three commits on the feature branch.

# Questions:
# 1. What is the purpose of using `-b` in the `git checkout` command?
# 2. Why is it beneficial to commit frequently while working on a feature branch?
```

### Step 4: Merging Main into Feature
```
# Fetch the latest changes from the main branch:
git fetch origin main

# Merge the main branch into your feature branch:
git merge origin/main

# Diagram:
# Before Merge:
# Main Branch:    A---B---C---D---H
# Feature Branch:        \---E---F---G
# After Merge (Main into Feature):
# Main Branch:    A---B---C---D---H
# Feature Branch:        \---E---F---G---H

# Comment:
# This step shows the process of updating the feature branch with the latest changes from the main branch.

# Questions:
# 1. What happens during the merge of the main branch into your feature branch?
# 2. Why is it important to keep your feature branch up-to-date with the main branch?
# 3. When should you perform this merge?
# 4. Main branch has a new commit (H) what happened to it when merged?
```

### Step 5: Pushing Feature Branch Up
```
# Push your feature branch to the remote repository:
git push origin DEAL-123-description

# Diagram:
# Remote Repository:
# Main Branch:    A---B---C---D---H
# Feature Branch:        \---E---F---G---H

# Comment:
# This step shows the process of pushing your updated feature branch to the remote repository.

# Questions:
# 1. Why is it important to push your feature branch to the remote repository?
# 2. What are the benefits of regularly pushing your changes?
# 3. How did we push a new branch to github?
```

### Step 6: Merging Feature Back to Main
```
# Checkout the main branch:
git checkout main

# Merge the feature branch into the main branch:
git merge DEAL-123-description

# Diagram:
# Before Final Merge:
# Main Branch:    A---B---C---D---H
# Feature Branch:        \---E---F---G---H
# After Final Merge (Feature back into Main):
# Main Branch:    A---B---C---D---H---E---F---G
# Feature Branch:        \---E---F---G---H

# Comment:
# This step shows the process of integrating the feature branch back into the main branch.

# Questions:
# 1. What happens when you merge the feature branch back into the main branch?
# 2. Why is it important to merge your feature branch back into the main branch?
# 3. Why is this a final step?
# 4. What are the benefits of this final merge step?
