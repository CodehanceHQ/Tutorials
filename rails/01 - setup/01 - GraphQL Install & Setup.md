# Rails API with GraphQL

### In this guide, we will install and configure GraphQL

```
# Step-by-Step Guide

# Step 1: Add Required Gems to the Gemfile
# Gemfile
gem 'graphql', '~> 2.3', '>= 2.3.2'
gem 'graphiql-rails', '~> 1.7', group: :development
gem 'propshaft', '~> 0.9.0', group: :development

# Install the gems
bundle install

# Questions:
# 1. What is graphql what alternatives are there?
# 2. How is Graphql different compared to REST?
# 3. What gems do you need to add to your Gemfile for GraphQL?
# 4. What command do you use to install the gems listed in the Gemfile?
# 5. Why is it important to list versions when installing Gems?
```

### Step 2: Install GraphQL
```
# Run the GraphQL installation generator
rails generate graphql:install

# Questions:
# 1. Can you remember the command used to generate graphql files?
# 2. What files are created by the GraphQL installation generator?
# 3. What does each file generated by generate graphql:install do?
# 4. Is it possible to create those files manually without generator?
```

### Step 3: Configure GraphiQL (Development Only)
```
# To use the GraphiQL interface for testing your GraphQL API, add the following route in your config/routes.rb file
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  if Rails.env.development?
    mount GraphiQL::Rails::Engine, at: "/graphiql", graphql_path: "/graphql"
  end
  post "/graphql", to: "graphql#execute"
end

# Questions:
# 1. Why do we add GraphiQL to our routes file and under what condition is it mounted?
# 2. What route do we add to handle GraphQL queries and mutations?
```

### Step 4: Start the Server
```
# Start the server to run your Rails application
rails server

# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/graphiql in your browser to access the GraphiQL interface.

# Questions:
# 1. What URL do you use to access the GraphiQL interface?
# 2. What is the purpose of the GraphiQL interface?
```

# Conclusion

```
In this guide, we've successfully installed and configured GraphQL in a Rails API application. We began by adding the necessary gems to our Gemfile and installing them, ensuring we have the tools required to use GraphQL. We then ran the GraphQL installation generator, which set up the essential files and configurations needed to start using GraphQL in our application. 

Next, we configured the GraphiQL interface, allowing us to easily test our GraphQL queries and mutations in a development environment. Finally, we started the Rails server and accessed the GraphiQL interface through the browser to test our setup.

By following these steps, you now have a functional GraphQL setup within your Rails API application. This configuration allows for efficient querying and mutation of data, providing a flexible and powerful alternative to traditional REST APIs. Remember to explore and customize the generated files and configurations to suit your application's specific needs. With GraphQL, you can create more efficient and powerful APIs, enhancing both the developer and user experience.
