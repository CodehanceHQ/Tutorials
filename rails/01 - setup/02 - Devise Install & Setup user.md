```

### Step 1: Install Devise

```
# Add Devise gem to the Gemfile
gem 'devise', '~> 4.8'

# Questions:
# 1. What is the purpose of adding `devise` to the Gemfile?
# 2. How do you specify a specific version of a gem in the Gemfile?

```

```
# Install the gems
bundle install

# Questions:
# 1. What does the command `bundle install` do?
# 2. How does Bundler ensure that the correct versions of gems are installed?
# 3. What file does Bundler use to manage gem dependencies?
```

### Step 2: Run the Devise Installation Generator

```
# Run the Devise installation generator
rails generate devise:install

# Questions:
# 1. What does the command `rails generate devise:install` do?
# 2. What files and configurations are set up by this generator?
# 3. How can you verify that Devise was installed correctly?
```

### Step 3: Generate a User Model with Devise

```
# Generate a User model with Devise
rails generate devise User

# Questions:
# 1. What command do you use to generate a User model with Devise?
# 2. What are the advantages of generating a User model with Devise?
# 3. What default attributes are added to the User model by Devise?
```

### Step 4: Add Attributes to the User Model

```
# Add the full name attribute to the User model
rails generate migration AddFullNameToUsers full_name:string

# Questions:
# 1. Why do we need to run the command `rails generate migration AddFullNameToUsers fullName:string`?
# 2. What is the purpose of adding a full name attribute to the User model?
# 3. How does the migration file generated by this command look?
# 4. What does an index field mean in context of generated file?

# Add the telephone number attribute to the User model, string because of e.g +44
rails generate migration AddTelephoneToUsers telephone:string

# Questions:
# 1. What command do you use to add a telephone number attribute to the User model?
# 2. Why is it important to include the data type when adding a new column in a migration?
```

### Step 5: Run the Migrations

```
# Run the migrations
rails db:migrate

# Questions:
# 1. What does running `rails db:migrate` accomplish?
# 2. What happens if there are issues with the migration?
# 3. How can you check the status of migrations in your Rails application?
```

### Conclusion

```
In this guide, we've walked through the essential steps to install and set up Devise in a Rails application. We began by understanding the purpose and features of Devise, then proceeded to install the necessary gems and run the installation generator. We also generated a User model with Devise, added additional attributes to enhance the user profile, and ran migrations to update the database schema.

By following these steps, you should now have a fully functional authentication system integrated into your Rails application. This setup provides a robust foundation for managing user authentication, allowing you to focus on building the other features of your application.

Remember to test your setup thoroughly and customize the Devise and configurations as needed to meet the specific requirements of your project. With Devise, you have a powerful tool that simplifies authentication, making it easier to develop secure and user-friendly applications.
