## Understanding Classes in Ionic Angular: A Beginner's Guide


### Introduction
Welcome to the course! In this lesson, we will explore the fundamental concepts of classes, methods, properties, and objects in Ionic Angular. By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how each component works and how they are used in Angular development.

### Stop any previously running ionic app
First, ensure that any Ionic app you may have running is stopped.

### Classes
Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. In Ionic Angular, classes help in structuring your code by defining reusable components.

### Methods
Methods are functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors of an object. They allow objects to perform actions. There are different types of methods:
- **Instance Methods**: Operate on an instance of the class.
- **Static Methods**: Operate on the class itself, not on instances.

### Properties
Properties are variables that hold data associated with a class and its objects. They define the characteristics of an object. There are different types of properties:
- **Instance Properties**: Belong to an instance of the class.
- **Static Properties**: Belong to the class itself, not any instance.

### Objects
Objects are instances of a class. They represent real-world entities and are created using the class blueprint. An object has its own unique values for the properties defined by the class.

### Practical Example (Theoretical Explanation)
Let's consider a theoretical example to illustrate these concepts:

#### UserProfile Class
Imagine we have a `UserProfile` class that represents a user profile in an application.

- **Properties**:
  - `username`: The username of the user.
  - `email`: The email address of the user.
  - `age`: The age of the user.
  - `isLoggedIn`: A boolean indicating if the user is logged in.

- **Methods**:
  - `login()`: A method to log the user in.
  - `logout()`: A method to log the user out.
  - `updateEmail(newEmail)`: A method to update the user's email.

#### Creating an Object
When we create a new user profile, we are creating an instance of the `UserProfile` class. For example, a user profile with the username "johnDoe" and email "john@example.com" is an object created from the `UserProfile` class.

### Summary
In this lesson, we've covered the basic concepts of classes, methods, properties, and objects in Ionic Angular. These are fundamental building blocks that will help you understand how to structure and organize your code effectively.
