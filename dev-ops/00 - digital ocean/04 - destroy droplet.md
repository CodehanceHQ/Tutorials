### Destroying Droplet

It is important to destroy your droplet after use, especially during the learning stages, to avoid unnecessary costs. Digital Ocean charges for droplets based on their uptime and resource usage. Even if a droplet is idle, it incurs charges. 

So to keep your free trial credits running for longer we have to destroy the droplets after use.

By destroying droplets you no longer need, you can manage your expenses effectively and ensure you are not billed for unused resources.

### Steps to Destroy a Droplet

1. **Log in to your Digital Ocean account**:
   Visit https://www.digitalocean.com and log in with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to the Droplets section**:
   Once logged in, go to the "Droplets" section in the main dashboard.

3. **Select the droplet to destroy**:
   Find the droplet you want to destroy from the list of droplets. Click on the droplet to open its management page.

4. **Initiate the destroy process**:
   On the droplet's management page, click on the "Destroy" button located at the top right corner of the page.

5. **Confirm the destruction**:
   A confirmation dialog will appear asking you to confirm the destruction. Read the information carefully to ensure you are destroying the correct droplet. Confirm by clicking the "Destroy" button.

6. **Final verification**:
   After confirming, the droplet will be destroyed, and it will no longer appear in your list of active droplets.
